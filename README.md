# iMGEN-backend
 ## Introduction
The Backend system for iMGEN: Next Generation Image Generator -- A meme image generator. This program must be used in conjunction with `iMGEN-frontend`, you can clone that in my another repo.
## Before Use
Do some update on the downloaded codes:
* `application.yml`, to configure datasource and mail service properly;
* RSA key pairs under the `resource/keypair` folder (this program does some works for security (but in fact nothing more than a toy XDDD));
* client urls (search `client url` in your editor or something similar) for the Frontend system. (I ran this program with node.js on my computer so the client url is `http://localhost:3000`)
## Preview
See in `README.md` of `iMGEN-frontend`
